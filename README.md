Annin (杏仁) is a simple editor made with [mavonEditor](https://github.com/hinesboy/mavonEditor/). 

Annin does not collect any data.

Annin supports Markdown format and its preview.

The window of Annin is fixed with 740 x 500 for my chromebook (its resolution is only 1366 x 768).

The save button does not work for now.
